 dummy Github repository named "**dummy-github-events**" and used to perform ***pull, push, and merge events*** for webhook implementation
 
 
 ## Webhooks

To set up webhooks, you will need to use NGROK to create a tunnel to your local machine. Follow the instructions in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCxt9SAnkyc

Once you have NGROK running, you can create a webhook in your Github account that points to the NGROK URL. The webhook should be set up to track push, pull, and merge events.
